# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project has been used in the production environment for the past two years, handling thousands of requests per second and millions of messages with great success.

However, in order to open source the project and make it available to a wider audience, we had to make some changes.

We are releasing it with a `0.0.x` version as a stepping stone towards the full open-sourced version `1.0.0`, which we will be releasing soon.

For now all `0.0.x` versions are supported and will keep getting security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

| 0.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
